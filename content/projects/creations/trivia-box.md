  "description": "A multiplayer real-time trivia system. I initially envisioned it as a way to be paired with simple IoT devices (like rpis) running the server, so that trivia gamerunners could bring the devices with them to a location and run game servers on-the-go, allowing any client on the same network to play. The idea is to eventually expand to a cloud-backed service to support over-the-internet play.",
