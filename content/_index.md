Full-stack engineer with experience building consumer-facing web applications and services, in both startup and enterprise environments. I’ve been involved at every level of these types of projects:  top-level architecture, CI/CD design, large-scale feature implementation, and minor (and sometimes major!) bug fixes – sometimes as part of a team, other times one-manning a project with complete ownership.
